NetDash Base Kubernetes Resources
=================================

These resources are intended to be used with `kustomize` as a base upon which your institution can apply overlay patches to create environments (such as `dev` or `prod`). See the comments inside the resource definitions for suggestions on properties to overlay.

Requires `kustomize` version 2.1 or higher. For more information about using `kustomize`, please see: https://kustomize.io/
